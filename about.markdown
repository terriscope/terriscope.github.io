## Bio

<a href="/images/thomas-large.jpg"><img src="/images/thomas-thumb.jpg" alt="thomas bonfort" align="right" style="padding:5px"/></a>
My name is _Thomas Bonfort_, I'm a core [MapServer][mapserver] developer and project
steering comitee (PSC) member, and specialize in custom development and support around the MapServer solutions.

I have a PhD in applied mathematics and computer science, and have been heavily 
invested around MapServer development since then, until becoming a _de-facto_ maintainer
nowadays. My [resume][cv] outlines some core contributions and projects. 

When I'm not hacking on code or trying to help out on the mailing lists, I mostly enjoy
travelling, skiing and canyoning.

## TerriScope

_TerriScope_ is my consulting company, setup as a _EURL_ (basically a _LLP_ in the US,
or _Pvt. Ltd._ in the UK) in Toulouse, France.
